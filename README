About
=====

Back in October 2006, I got bored one weekend and decided that the Gentoo Linux
Installer (GLI, or "the installer") sucked and was no longer on track to
achieve its original goal of acting as an installer for automated deployments
of Gentoo to multiple machines. I decided that I would address one of the chief
complaints about GLI (that python was too bloated to fit in a netboot image) by
writing my replacement in POSIX sh, so that it could run with busybox ash. Thus,
Quickstart was born.

The first version had a very cumbersome config syntax (defining vars in a
"profile" which was sourced by install.sh). Newer versions use a config syntax
that's modeled on Kickstart's config syntax. Under the hood, it's still the same
arcane variables, but now they're hidden by pretty "wrapper" functions that set
the variables appropriately based on the options passed to them. A list of all
configurable options is available in the file doc/config.txt. You can also find
an example profile in the same directory.
